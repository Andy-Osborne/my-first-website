# My First Web Page

Welcome to my first attempt at a web page on GitHub.

This is purely to explore the use of GitHub before I delve into proper projects. 

Within this project, I am using simple HTML5 and CSS3 to style the various pages within the project that
will provide an overview of what I am going to learn within my course with Code Institute.

The outlay for this project will be basic however; it's by mastering these basic concepts that I can further
improve upon my knowledge as a developer.
